This is a simple webapp I wrote in node to practice new technologies. The projects frontend has been rewritten to use angular2 from just using typescript & dom manipulation. 

The idea behind the project itself though was to practice words from 1 language to another. Which it does well in its current iteration but some quality improvements could be made!

For gh-pages I abstracted out the backend calls so you can test the frontend directly:
