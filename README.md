This is a webapp I wrote to practice angular5. 
The app itself is a way to practice finnish language by practising phrases.

It uses many features from angular such as services, components and routing.
The backend is an express app that handles api calls to manipulate the database data.  

The app can be tested here: https://haestflod.github.io/glossarytraining/dist/
