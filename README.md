This is a simple program I wrote in node to practice new technologies. Had barely used express before and first time using typescript.
Now the goal is to rewrite the frontend to use angularjs 2.0 instead of just typescript.

There are parts in this project that hasn't been removed because of earlier iterations. Such as it used redit server early on but I dropped that because it was too much effort learning it and also get proper relations between things like words, categories. So its using MySQL now to speed that up.
